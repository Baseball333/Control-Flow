# Control-Flow
My notes on the "Control Flow" chapter in "the C:Programming Language".

First Commit: 
This file describes my notes in the "Control Flow" chapter of "the C: Programming Language". In programming control flow describes the order of computations. The first classification is "statements and blocks".

Second Commit:
In C an expression becomes a statement when it is terminated with a semicolon.

Third Commit:
If-else control flow is the base of C operation, described through the following structure.
if (expression)
   statement1
else
   statement2

Fourth Commit:
The evaluation of an expression relies on its validity; If the expression is valid, statement1 is executed. If the opposite is true statement2 is executed.
The else portion of an if-else is optional, thus ambiguity arises when else is omitted. The following program describes such a situation.
