# Control-Flow
My notes on the "Control Flow" chapter in "the C:Programming Language".

First Commit: 
This file describes my notes in the "Control Flow" chapter of "the C: Programming Language". In programming control flow describes the order of computations. The first classification is "statements and blocks".

Second Commit:
In C an expression becomes a statement when it is terminated with a semicolon.

Third Commit:
If-else control flow is the base of C operation, described through the following structure.
if (expression)
   statement1
else
   statement2

Fourth Commit:
The evaluation of an expression relies on its validity; If the expression is valid, statement1 is executed. If the opposite is true statement2 is executed.
The else portion of an if-else is optional, thus ambiguity arises when else is omitted. The following program describes such a situation.

Fifth Commit:
The majority of this chapter's notes has been written on Emacs and not transferred to Github. The remainder of the chapter will be represented by code uploaded to
the remainder of this repository.

Sixth Commit:
The next file describes a program which finds an element within an array.
